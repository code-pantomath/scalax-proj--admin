# Scalax_admin

This is the admin part of the scalax experimental project (for fun :) ), its a console app meant to gain simple shell control overseas into any other (win,mac,linux) that has the other (client-part) installed on it. (The whole project was devoloped in couple hours and isn't meant to be strongly written, therfore uses alot of bad stupid practices!:]
